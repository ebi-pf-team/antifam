AntiFam
=======

AntiFam is a resource of profile-HMMs designed to identify spurious
protein predictions. AntiFam profile-HMMs come from two sources:

 i) A number of spurious Pfam families have been built in the past. These
    were based on erronous gene predictions.  These protein families
    have been deleted from Pfam, but new proteins may be predicted.

 ii) Profile-HMMs have been created from translations of commonly occuring
     non-coding RNAs such as tRNAs. 

This collection of profile-HMM models is designed to be used as a
quality control step for the UniProt sequence database as well as
metagenomic projects.


Release   # Entries
   1.0        8
   1.1       23    
   1.2       29

Below is the complete list of spurious families and the stated reason for
removal. For each family that has been derived from a Pfam entry, the last 
release of Pfam that contained the live family is shown.


ANF00001 Spurious_ORF_01

Family has been deleted after concerns that these proteins may not be expressed.  Evidence for this is homology to proteins on opposite strand. PF07612 (15.0)

ANF00002 Spurious_ORF_02

Family has been deleted after concerns that these proteins may not be expressed.  Evidence for this is homology to proteins on opposite strand. PF07616 (15.0)

ANF00003 Spurious_ORF_03

Family has been deleted after concerns that these proteins may not be expressed.  Evidence for this is homology to proteins on opposite strand. PF07630 (15.0)

ANF00004 Spurious_ORF_04

Family has been deleted after concerns that these proteins may not be expressed.  Evidence for this is homology to proteins on opposite strand. PF07633 (15.0)

ANF00005 Spurious_ORF_05

Family identified by James Tripp as antisense to 23S rRNA. PF10695 (25.0)

ANF00006 Spurious_ORF_06

DUF that Dan Haft from TIGRFAM said were translations of DNA regions that are CRISPR repeat regions. PF11194 (25.0)

ANF00007 Spurious_ORF_07

DUF that Dan Haft from TIGRFAM thought looked like a shadow ORF in the -1 reading frame of Clp protease. PF11370 (25.0)

ANF00008 Spurious_ORF_08

DUF that Dan Haft from TIGRFAM said were translations of DNA regions that are CRISPR repeat regions. PF11664 (25.0)

DUF that Dan Haft identified as a shadow of PF00665. PF10919 (26.0)

Family deleted as identified as antisense to 23S rRNA. PF14211 (26.0)

ANF00025 Spurious_ORF_25

How to use AntiFam
==================

AntiFam is composed of a collection of alignments found in the file AntiFam.seed.
Using the HMMER3 software a library of profile-HMMs was built. This library is
found in the file AntiFam.hmm.

To use the hmm library you must first make index files with the following command

  hmmpress AntiFam.hmm

To search AntiFam against a set of sequences you run the following command

  hmmsearch --cut_ga AntiFam.hmm yourseq.fasta

Any reported matches are very likely to be spurious gene predictions.
