AntiFam
=======

AntiFam is a resource of profile-HMMs designed to identify spurious
protein predictions. AntiFam profile-HMMs come from two sources:

 i) A number of spurious Pfam families have been built in the past. These
    were based on erronous gene predictions.  These protein families
    have been deleted from Pfam, but new proteins may be predicted.

 ii) Profile-HMMs have been created from translations of commonly occuring
     non-coding RNAs such as tRNAs. 

This collection of profile-HMM models is designed to be used as a
quality control step for the UniProt sequence database as well as
metagenomic projects.


Release   # Pfams 
   1.0       8    

Below is the complete list of spurious families and the stated reason for
removal. After each Pfam accession and antifam ID the last release of Pfam
that contained the live family is shown.


PF07612 Spurious_ORF_01 (15.0)

Family has been deleted after concerns that these proteins may not be expressed.  Evidence for this is homology to proteins on opposite strand

PF07616 Spurious_ORF_02 (15.0)

Family has been deleted after concerns that these proteins may not be expressed.  Evidence for this is homology to proteins on opposite strand

PF07630 Spurious_ORF_03 (15.0)

Family has been deleted after concerns that these proteins may not be expressed.  Evidence for this is homology to proteins on opposite strand

PF07633 Spurious_ORF_04 (15.0)

Family has been deleted after concerns that these proteins may not be expressed.  Evidence for this is homology to proteins on opposite strand

PF10695 Spurious_ORF_05 (25.0)

Family identified by James Tripp as antisense to rRNA.

PF11194 Spurious_ORF_06 (25.0)

DUF that Dan Haft from TIGRFAM said were translations of DNA regions that are CRISPR repeat regions. 

PF11370 Spurious_ORF_07 (25.0)

DUF that Dan Haft from TIGRFAM thought looked like a shadow ORF in the -1 reading frame of Clp protease.

PF11664 Spurious_ORF_08 (25.0)

DUF that Dan Haft from TIGRFAM said were translations of DNA regions that are CRISPR repeat regions. 

PF10919 Spurious_ORF_09 (26.0)

DUF that Dan Haft identified as a shadow of PF00665

How to use AntiFam
==================

AntiFam is composed of a collection of alignments found in the file AntiFam.seed.
Using the HMMER3 software a library of profile-HMMs was built. This library is
found in the file AntiFam.hmm.

To use the hmmlirary you must first make index files with the following command

  hmmpress AntiFam.hmm

To search AntiFam against a set of sequences you run the following command

  hmmsearch --cut_ga AntiFam.hmm yourseq.fasta

Any reported matches are very likely to be spurious gene predictions.
