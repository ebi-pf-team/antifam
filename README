AntiFam Production
==================

Welcome to the AntiFam production directory.  This is the real, live version of
AntiFam so please be careful with it! The file gives some explanation of the structure
and contents of the directory.

Contents
========

The following directories should be found here:

RELEASES - Contains all previous released versions of AntiFam
PAPERS   - Contains copies of papers describing AntiFam plus relevant
           data used when writing the papers
SCRIPTS  - Contains perl scripts used for AntiFam
ENTRIES  - Contains AntiFam entries

Making releases
===============

AntiFam has been designed to be low maintenance as well as quick to make releases.
To make a new release simply run the build_release.pl script.

pfam3a% ./build_release.pl <version number>

A new directory is created by this script for the release in RELEASES. 
In that directory are several files including the AntiFam.tar.gz release
bundle. Note that the relnotes file in this directory should be up to date
before running this script as it is simply copied into the release directory.

This zip file should be copied to the ftp site as in the example below

pfam3a% cd /nfs/disk69/ftp/pub/databases/Pfam/AntiFam
pfam3a% cp /warehouse/pfam01/antifam/RELEASES/3.0/AntiFam_3.0.tar.gz .

It should also be copied to the "current" directory on the ftp site as AntiFam.tar.gz
